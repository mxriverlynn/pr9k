# Signal Handling & Shutdown

Handles OS signals (SIGINT/SIGTERM) to trigger clean shutdown of the ralph-tui workflow, terminating the active subprocess and exiting with the appropriate status code.

## Overview

- Listens for SIGINT and SIGTERM via `os/signal.Notify` on a buffered channel
- On signal receipt, calls `KeyHandler.ForceQuit()` which terminates the active subprocess and injects `ActionQuit` into the orchestration channel
- The orchestration loop picks up the quit action before the next step starts via a non-blocking channel drain
- The main goroutine tracks whether a signal was received to select the exit code: 0 for normal completion, 1 for signal-initiated shutdown

## Implementation Details

### Signal Registration

In `main.go`, signals are registered before the workflow goroutine starts:

```go
sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(sigChan, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
signaled := make(chan struct{})
go func() {
    <-sigChan
    close(signaled)
    keyHandler.ForceQuit()
    app.Stop()
    select {
    case <-done:
    case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
    }
    os.Exit(1)
}()
```

The `signaled` channel is a one-shot flag — once closed, it stays closed. The signal handler calls `app.Stop()` to tear down the Glyph TUI, waits up to 2 seconds for the workflow goroutine to finish (so the log is flushed), then calls `os.Exit(1)` directly.

### ForceQuit Integration

`KeyHandler.ForceQuit()` does three things:
1. Flips mode to `ModeQuitting` and updates the shortcut bar (so the footer shows `"Quitting..."` immediately)
2. Calls the `cancel` function (which is `Runner.Terminate()`) to stop the active subprocess
3. Non-blocking sends `ActionQuit` to the `Actions` channel so the orchestration loop exits cleanly

The non-blocking send (`select`/`default`) ensures `ForceQuit` never blocks, which is critical since it runs in a signal handler goroutine.

`ForceQuit` is called from **two** places and both produce identical shutdown semantics:
- The OS signal handler goroutine (this file)
- The QuitConfirm `y` path in `KeyHandler.handleQuitConfirm` (see [Keyboard Input](keyboard-input.md))

Unifying these paths means the signal-initiated and user-confirmed quit flows go through the same subprocess-termination + ActionQuit-injection sequence. A test harness that drives `y` from an error-mode step gets the same behavior as sending SIGINT at the terminal.

### Pre-Step Drain

Before each step, `Orchestrate()` performs a non-blocking drain of the `Actions` channel:

```go
select {
case action := <-h.Actions:
    if action == ActionQuit { return ActionQuit }
default:
}
```

This catches the `ActionQuit` injected by `ForceQuit` even if the signal arrives between steps (when no goroutine is blocking on the channel).

### Workflow Goroutine Cleanup

On normal workflow completion, `signal.Stop`, `log.Close`, and `app.Stop` all run inside the workflow goroutine before `done` is closed:

```go
go func() {
    defer close(done)
    _ = workflow.Run(runner, header, keyHandler, runCfg)
    signal.Stop(sigChan)  // deregister signal handler
    _ = log.Close()       // flush and close the log file
    app.Stop()            // stop the Glyph TUI
}()
```

Placing cleanup here ensures it always runs when the workflow finishes naturally, without relying on the main goroutine to sequence it.

### Exit Code Selection

After `app.Run()` returns, the main goroutine waits for the workflow goroutine and checks whether a signal was received:

```go
select {
case <-done:
case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
}

select {
case <-signaled:
    os.Exit(1)  // signal-initiated shutdown (defensive; signal handler already exited)
default:
    os.Exit(0)  // normal completion
}
```

In the signal path, the signal handler goroutine already called `os.Exit(1)` directly. The exit code check in main is a defensive fallback for the case where `app.Run()` returns before the signal handler fires.

## Testing

Signal handling is tested indirectly through:
- `ralph-tui/internal/ui/ui_test.go` — Tests for `ForceQuit` behavior (cancel called, ActionQuit sent)
- `ralph-tui/internal/ui/orchestrate_test.go` — Tests for pre-step quit drain (ActionQuit injected before step starts)
