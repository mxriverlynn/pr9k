# Docker Sandbox for Claude — Design Plan

Status: **Design — not implemented**.
Target ralph-tui version: **0.3.0** (breaking change — `y` bump from `0.2.3` per `docs/coding-standards/versioning.md`).

> **Plan currency note (iteration 4, 2026-04-13):** Between the design
> freeze and re-review, commit `4f4481b` ("fixing issues with working
> dir vs executing dir", bumping to `0.2.3`) landed a narrower
> clean-up of the project-dir-vs-cwd confusion: it captured
> `workingDir` via `os.Getwd()` in `main.go` and routed it into the
> logger and runner without touching flags or variables. This plan's
> §4.15 split is still the intended 0.3.0 endpoint, but §9's rename
> inventory and main.go line references below have been reconciled
> against the post-`4f4481b` state. See §14 iteration 4 for a summary.

## 1. Overview

Today, ralph-tui invokes `claude` as a direct subprocess of the host
(`ralph-tui/internal/workflow/run.go:243`), sharing the host's filesystem,
environment, and process namespace. Because ralph-tui runs claude with
`--permission-mode bypassPermissions` inside an unattended loop, any
hallucinated destructive action has the full blast radius of the invoking user.

This plan moves every claude invocation into an ephemeral Docker container
built from the `docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code` image, bind-mounting only
the target repo and the Claude profile directory into the container.
Everything else on the host — other repos, `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, cached
credentials, arbitrary env vars — becomes invisible to claude.

A new `ralph-tui create-sandbox` subcommand pulls the image and verifies the
host can launch containers under its own UID. At startup, ralph-tui refuses to
run until the sandbox is present, Docker is reachable, and the Claude profile
directory exists.

This release also splits the ambiguous `--project-dir` flag into
`--workflow-dir` (the workflow bundle — `ralph-steps.json`, `prompts/`,
`scripts/`, `ralph-art.txt`) and `--project-dir` (the target repo, newly
first-class because the sandbox bind-mount needs to name it distinctly
from the workflow bundle). See §4.14 and the split ADR for rationale.

## 2. Goal & Non-Goals

### Goal
Contain claude's blast radius to **(a) the bind-mounted target repo** and
**(c) a scrubbed process environment** — filesystem isolation plus host
isolation. The user owns the repo; if claude corrupts files inside it, that is
recoverable through git. Files, secrets, and other repos outside the mount are
invisible to claude.

### Non-goals
- **Network isolation.** Claude needs outbound HTTPS to the Anthropic API,
  and prompts may reach public registries or GitHub. Restricting egress is
  a separate, larger project and is deferred.
- **Parallelism.** Running multiple ralph loops concurrently is out of scope.
  The sandbox design neither enables it nor blocks it; conflicts over the
  target repo remain the user's problem.
- **Reproducibility of the claude-code runtime.** We pull by tag, not by
  digest (see §4.10). Users accept Docker's upstream as the source of truth
  for claude-code versions.
- **Sandboxing non-claude steps.** Shell steps (`scripts/close_gh_issue`,
  `scripts/get_commit_sha`, `git push`, etc.) continue to run directly on the
  host. They need host `gh`/`git` credentials and are a different threat
  class.

## 3. Threat Model

### In scope
| Attack                                            | Mitigated by                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Claude `rm -rf`s outside the repo                 | No bind mount outside `<PROJECT_DIR>` (target repo) |
| Claude reads `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, other repos      | Not bind-mounted; container sees empty `$HOME`   |
| Claude exfiltrates host env vars                  | `-e` allowlist; no `-e $(env)`                   |
| Upstream tool on host is subverted by claude work | Claude cannot invoke host binaries               |

### Accepted residual risk
| Risk                                              | Why accepted                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Claude corrupts `~/.claude/.credentials.json`     | Profile is mounted read-write; user already runs `bypassPermissions` against far more sensitive files in the repo itself. Re-authenticating is cheap. |
| Malicious upstream `docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code` push | Same trust assumption as `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` today. Tag-based pulls deliberately trade pinning for upgrade ergonomics. |
| Prompts tell claude to shell out to `gh`, `curl`, etc. | Image bundles a minimal tool set. Calls fail inside the container. **Note:** claude-code's agent loop may observe `command not found` and fall back to other approaches (e.g., hand-rolled HTTPS if `curl` is present, or simply writing something plausible to the repo). The sandbox does not guarantee a visible step error — the guarantee is "no host tool access", not "no semantic regression in the commit." The repo mount is read-write, so semantic corruption inside the repo remains a risk; git history is the backstop. |

## 4. Architectural Decisions

Each decision was resolved one-by-one during design review. Numbered for
reference.

1. **Goal shape: filesystem + host isolation (a+c).** Network isolation and
   parallelism deferred (§2).
2. **Approach: raw `docker run` against the official image.** Not the `sbx`
   CLI (adds an install dependency with humans-first defaults); not a custom
   Dockerfile (added maintenance burden for no current benefit). Raw
   `docker run` gives us full flag control with zero new dependencies.
3. **Profile directory mount: `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `$HOME/.claude`.**
   Resolved at ralph-tui startup to an absolute path. Bind-mounted to
   `/home/agent/.claude` inside the container. Read-write (see §4.4).
4. **Profile mount mode: read-write (`:rw`).** Claude needs to refresh OAuth
   tokens mid-run; read-only would cause silent auth failures in long
   unattended loops. Credential corruption is an accepted residual risk — the
   user is already running bypassPermissions against unmerged work in the
   repo, which is usually more sensitive than a refreshable credentials file.
5. **Sandbox is unconditional.** No `--no-sandbox` flag, no per-step opt-out,
   no auto-detect. Safety requirements that are opt-out accidentally become
   opt-out the day you need them on.
6. **`ralph-tui create-sandbox` subcommand.** Explicit setup action that
   produces the artifacts ralph-tui requires at startup. Without this command
   a user would have to run `docker pull` manually, which is worse UX.
7. **`create-sandbox` produces: a local copy of the tagged image, smoke-tested
   under the invoking user's UID.** Not a long-lived named container (that
   accumulates cross-iteration state and defeats the fresh-environment
   property of sandboxing). Not a custom-built image (§4.2).
8. **Docker command location: hardcoded in Go at the same site as today's
   claude invocation.** The narrow-reading-principle ADR
   ([docs/adr/20260410170952-narrow-reading-principle.md](../../adr/20260410170952-narrow-reading-principle.md))
   already tolerates the existing hardcoded claude command here; we extend
   that slice rather than refactoring the step abstraction in the same PR.
   Moving claude-step resolution into `ralph-steps.json` proper is a
   legitimate later refactor that should be done separately.
9. **UID/GID mapping: `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)`.** Files claude writes into the
   bind-mounted repo are owned by the host user, so subsequent shell steps
   (git, gh) and cleanup behave the same whether claude ran directly or in a
   container. Verified working for this image via smoke test (§11).
10. **Image reference: tag only.** `docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code`, not
    pinned by digest. Users get upstream updates by re-running
    `ralph-tui create-sandbox --force`. Trade-off: less reproducibility, more
    trust in the upstream image — the user chose this cadence.
11. **Environment passthrough: layered allowlist.** Ralph-tui always attempts
    to pass five "sandbox-plumbing" variables (see §5). A new top-level `env`
    field in `ralph-steps.json` lets workflows extend the list with
    workflow-specific variables (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`).
    Exact names only — no glob or prefix wildcards in v1.
12. **Lifecycle: `--rm --init --cidfile <tmp>` with `-i`, no `-t`.** `--rm`
    auto-cleans the container. `--init` installs tini as PID 1 so SIGTERM is
    forwarded and reaped correctly. `--cidfile` captures the container ID so
    we can `docker kill` on quit. No `-t` because a TTY corrupts line-buffered
    stdout that the capture layer depends on.
13. **Termination: `docker kill` via cidfile, SIGTERM → 3s grace → SIGKILL.**
    Ralph-tui's existing `Runner.Terminate()` logic is preserved but driven
    through a new `terminator` closure stored on the Runner, so
    sandbox-aware termination does not leak into the orchestration layer.
    Escalation ownership is precise: the closure performs the TERM step
    *and* the KILL step (both via `docker kill --signal=TERM|KILL <cid>`);
    `Runner.Terminate()` keeps the existing 3-second grace timer and
    decides *when* to escalate by invoking the closure twice — once for
    TERM, once for KILL after the grace expires. This matters because
    signaling the host `docker` CLI with `proc.Kill()` (today's fallback
    path in `workflow.go:101`) would only kill the CLI process and orphan
    the running container; escalation must go through `docker kill` to
    hit the container itself. See §9 for the `Runner` struct changes.
14. **Testing: unit-test command builder + unit-test preflight with injected
    prober + manual smoke checklist.** No CI integration tests against real
    Docker.
15. **Split `--project-dir` into `--workflow-dir` (current meaning) and
    `--project-dir` (target repo, new).** The sandbox bind-mount
    (`-v <PROJECT_DIR>:/home/agent/workspace`, §5) needs a name for the
    target repo distinct from the workflow bundle. Today's `--project-dir`
    unambiguously resolves to the workflow bundle
    (`ralph-tui/internal/cli/args.go:22-56`, `vars/vars.go:63`), but
    design.md has been sloppily using `<PROJECT_DIR>` to mean the target
    repo in the mount template — exposing a latent ambiguity that will
    bite readers. The split names each concept once:
    `--workflow-dir` / `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` / `WorkflowDir` inherits current
    semantics (default: executable-path + `EvalSymlinks`), and
    `--project-dir` / `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` / `ProjectDir` becomes a new
    identifier for the target repo (default: `os.Getwd()` +
    `EvalSymlinks`; overridable by the user). Short forms (`-p`) are
    dropped — the ambiguity caused past confusion, and the long names
    force the user to read what they're typing. No deprecation alias:
    `--project-dir` means something different before and after, so a
    silently-accepted alias would mount the wrong directory. Delivered
    in the same `0.3.0` PR as the sandbox (§11). Rationale recorded in
    the new split ADR alongside this plan.

    **Relation to the `0.2.3` `workingDir` capture.** Commit `4f4481b`
    already introduced an internal `workingDir` captured via
    `os.Getwd()` at `ralph-tui/cmd/ralph-tui/main.go:77` and routed it
    to the logger and runner. That capture is the *same value* the
    split's new `--project-dir` / `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` will surface as a
    flag and VarTable entry — the split is a promotion of the existing
    internal concept to first-class user-facing surface. The split
    adds `filepath.EvalSymlinks` (the 0.2.3 capture is a raw
    `os.Getwd()` string), adds the `--project-dir` flag override, and
    seeds the value into the VarTable. No re-wiring of logger/runner
    is required — those already take the target repo. The `workingDir`
    identifier in current code is renamed to `projectDir` as part of
    the split.

## 5. The Runtime Docker Command

The template below is the source of truth for the command ralph-tui
constructs for every claude step. Substituted values in `<ANGLE_BRACKETS>`.
After the §4.15 split, `<PROJECT_DIR>` unambiguously means the target repo
(ralph-tui's new `--project-dir` flag, defaulting to `os.Getwd()`). The
workflow bundle — `<WORKFLOW_DIR>` — is **not** mounted: claude runs
against the target repo, and any workflow artifacts it needs (prompts,
scripts) are interpolated into argv or prompt text on the host before
the container starts.

```
docker run                                              \
  --rm                                                  \
  -i                                                    \
  --init                                                \
  --cidfile <TMP>/ralph-<UNIQUE>.cid                    \
  -u <UID>:<GID>                                        \
  -v <PROJECT_DIR>:/home/agent/workspace                \
  -v <PROFILE_DIR>:/home/agent/.claude                  \
  -w /home/agent/workspace                              \
  -e CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/agent/.claude              \
  [-e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY]                                \
  [-e ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL]                               \
  [-e HTTPS_PROXY]                                      \
  [-e HTTP_PROXY]                                       \
  [-e NO_PROXY]                                         \
  [-e <EACH_ENTRY_FROM_RALPH_STEPS_JSON_ENV>]           \
  docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code                  \
  claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions            \
         --model <MODEL>                                \
         -p <PROMPT>
```

### Flag rationale (flag-by-flag)

- `--rm`: container is ephemeral — one per claude step, deleted on exit.
- `-i`: attach stdin. Only safe when ralph-tui explicitly hands docker an
  empty stdin — otherwise docker inherits the parent's stdin FD. Bubble
  Tea already reads `os.Stdin` in raw mode for keyboard handling, and a
  second reader on the same TTY causes lost keystrokes and a wedged TUI.
  The sandbox caller MUST set `cmd.Stdin = bytes.NewReader(nil)` (or
  `os.DevNull`) before `cmd.Start()`. Code-change inventory calls this
  out in `run.go` / `workflow.go`. If there is no concrete evidence that
  omitting `-i` causes stdout truncation in this codepath (adversarial
  review noted the prior claim was not citation-backed), the Plan B is
  to drop `-i` entirely — both options are acceptable; the important
  invariant is "docker never shares a TTY with Bubble Tea." The plan
  defaults to `-i` + explicit empty stdin for symmetry with Docker's
  common usage, but implementers MAY drop `-i` if the no-stdin path
  proves cleaner.
- `--init`: install tini as PID 1 inside the container. Ensures SIGTERM
  actually gets to claude and zombies get reaped. Zero downside.
- `--cidfile <tmp>/ralph-<unique>.cid`: write the container ID to this file
  immediately. `Runner.Terminate()` reads it to issue a real `docker kill`
  rather than signaling the docker CLI (which would orphan the container).
  The cidfile path must not already exist when `docker run` starts; ralph-tui
  generates a unique path per step under `os.TempDir()` and removes it after
  `cmd.Wait()` returns. Cleanup runs in the same `defer` that clears
  `currentProc` / `currentTerminator`, so it also fires on panic, on
  Terminate()-driven exits, and when `docker run` fails before the
  container starts (cidfile may or may not exist — `os.Remove` + ignore
  ENOENT).
- `-u <UID>:<GID>`: run as the host user. Files written to the bind-mounted
  repo come out owned by you.
- `-v <PROJECT_DIR>:/home/agent/workspace`: bind-mount the target repo.
  `<PROJECT_DIR>` is the value of the new `--project-dir` flag (§4.15),
  defaulting to `os.Getwd()` and passed through `filepath.EvalSymlinks`
  so docker sees a real path. Matches the image's default `WORKDIR`, so
  relative paths claude resolves inside the container correspond to real
  host paths. The workflow bundle (`<WORKFLOW_DIR>`) is deliberately not
  mounted — see §8 and §13 for the token ban that enforces this.
- `-v <PROFILE_DIR>:/home/agent/.claude`: bind-mount the Claude profile.
  `<PROFILE_DIR>` is `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if set, else `$HOME/.claude`.
- `-w /home/agent/workspace`: explicit working directory (redundant with
  image default but defensive against future image changes).
- `-e CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/agent/.claude`: tell claude-code inside the
  container where its profile lives. Set inside the container regardless of
  whether the host had `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set — we do not passthrough this
  variable, we overwrite it to the mount point.
- `-e <NAME>` (no value): pass through host env var `NAME` if set, skip
  otherwise. Implemented as `if v, ok := os.LookupEnv(name); ok { args = append(args, "-e", name) }`.
  Built-in set: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `HTTPS_PROXY`,
  `HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`. User-extended from `ralph-steps.json`.
- `docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code`: tag-only image reference.
- `claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions --model <MODEL> -p <PROMPT>`:
  since we replace the image's default CMD (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`),
  we re-add the permission flag explicitly.

### What the command does NOT include
- `-t` (TTY): deliberately omitted — breaks line-buffered capture.
- `--network`: left as default bridge. See §2 non-goals.
- `-e HOME=...`: leave as the container's default (`/home/agent`).
  The image creates the agent user with a writable home.
- Resource limits (`--cpus`, `--memory`): not set in v1.

## 6. `create-sandbox` Subcommand Spec

### Invocation
```
ralph-tui create-sandbox [--force]
```

### Behavior
1. **Docker reachability check**
   - If `docker` is not on `PATH` (detected via `exec.LookPath`) →
     print: `Docker is not installed. Install Docker and try again.` → exit 1.
   - Run `docker version`. Non-zero exit →
     print: `Docker is installed but the daemon isn't running. Start Docker and try again.` → exit 1.
2. **Image pull**
   - If `docker image inspect docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code` exits 0
     AND `--force` was not passed →
     print: `Image docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code already present; skipping pull (use --force to re-pull).`
   - Otherwise → `docker pull docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code`, streaming
     progress. Non-zero exit →
     print: `Failed to pull sandbox image.` + stderr → exit 1.
3. **Smoke test**
   - Run: `docker run --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code claude --version`.
   - Capture both stdout and stderr; accept a version line from either
     (some node CLIs emit `--version` to stderr).
   - Failure cases with distinct messages so diagnostics match the cause:
     - Non-zero exit → `Sandbox smoke test failed — container exited with status <N>.` + captured stderr → exit 1.
     - Exit 0 but no output on either stream → `Sandbox smoke test failed — image ran but produced no version output. Image may be corrupted or a locally-tagged stub. Re-pull with --force.` → exit 1.
     - Exit 0 with output that does not match a semver-shaped pattern →
       `Sandbox smoke test warning — unexpected version output: <line>. Proceeding, but this image may not be the expected claude-code.` (warning, not failure — upstream output format is outside our control).
   - On success, print: `Sandbox verified: claude <version> under UID <UID>:<GID>.`
   - Note: this smoke test does NOT exercise writes with bind mounts, so
     it will not catch the "`agent` user can't write to `/home/agent/.cache`
     under host UID" failure mode — §10(d) manual checklist catches it.
4. **Done**
   - Print: `Sandbox ready.` → exit 0.

### Output shape
Structured step-by-step:
```
Checking Docker... ✓
Image present... skipping pull (use --force to re-pull)
Verifying sandbox... ✓ claude 2.1.101 under UID 501:20
Sandbox ready.
```

### Exit codes
- `0` — success.
- `1` — any failure. Remediation is printed above the exit.

## 7. Startup Preflight Spec

Runs once, at ralph-tui invocation (any command other than `create-sandbox`),
before the main orchestration loop begins.

### Sequence
1. Parse CLI flags and load `ralph-steps.json`. Existing config validation
   (D13) runs first; any config errors exit with existing behavior.
2. **Resolve profile dir**: `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if set, else `$HOME/.claude`.
   Expand to absolute.
3. **Profile dir check**: `os.Stat(profileDir)`. On miss:
   `Claude profile directory not found: <path>. Set CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or create ~/.claude.` → exit 1.
   If the stat succeeds but `fi.IsDir()` is false (e.g., the path
   resolves to a regular file), emit:
   `Claude profile path is not a directory: <path>. Point CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR at a directory.` → exit 1.
   This matches the explicit-precondition-validation standard
   (`docs/coding-standards/error-handling.md:26`) and the `os.Stat`
   behavior that succeeds on files.
4. **Docker reachability**:
   - `exec.LookPath("docker")` fails → `Docker is not installed. Install Docker and try again.` → exit 1.
   - `docker version` exits non-zero → `Docker is installed but the daemon isn't running. Start Docker and try again.` → exit 1.
5. **Sandbox image present**: `docker image inspect docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code`.
   Non-zero exit → `Claude sandbox image is missing. Run: ralph-tui create-sandbox` → exit 1.
6. **Credentials sanity (best-effort)**: if `<profileDir>/.credentials.json`
   exists and has size 0, emit a warning:
   `Warning: <path>/.credentials.json is empty. Claude will likely fail authentication. Re-authenticate with 'claude login' inside the sandbox.`
   Do NOT fail — only warn. This catches the SIGKILL-during-OAuth-refresh
   failure mode (see §13 adversarial notes). Absence of the file is not
   a warning condition (fresh profile is valid).
7. Enter main loop.

### Explicitly not done at startup
- **No smoke test at startup.** `create-sandbox` already verified the specific
  image + UID combination. Re-verifying costs a container start per
  ralph-tui invocation for marginal value.
- **No registry/network check.** If pull-time network is down, the preflight
  doesn't care — we already have the image locally.
- **No mid-run re-check.** Docker state shouldn't change during an
  iteration loop; if the daemon dies mid-run, the next `docker run` fails
  naturally and the user sees it in the normal error path.

## 8. Config Schema Change

### New top-level field: `env`

`ralph-steps.json` gains one new optional top-level entry: an array of host
environment variable names to pass through into the sandbox.

```json
{
  "env": ["GITHUB_TOKEN", "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"],
  "initialize": [ ... ],
  "iteration": [
    { "name": "Feature work", "isClaude": true, "model": "sonnet", "promptFile": "feature-work.md" },
    ...
  ],
  "finalize": [ ... ]
}
```

Note: the existing top-level schema is `initialize` / `iteration` / `finalize`
(see `ralph-tui/internal/steps/steps.go:27-31` and `ralph-tui/ralph-steps.json`).
`env` is a new sibling alongside those three phase arrays — not a wrapper
around them.

### Rules
- Optional. Absent `env` → equivalent to `"env": []`.
- Type: array of strings. Each string is a host env var name.
- Exact names only (no globs, no prefixes) in v1.
- Case-sensitive (env var names are case-sensitive).
- Duplicates and overlap with the built-in set are allowed and harmless
  (docker idempotently passes a var once).
- Unknown vars (not set on the host) are silently skipped — not an error.
  This matches `-e NAME` (no value) semantics.
- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `HOME` must NOT appear in the user `env` list.
  Both are set/managed by the sandbox itself (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is
  overwritten to the mount point; `HOME` is whatever the image sets).
  The validator rejects either name with a clear reason. This keeps the
  sandbox's own invariants out of reach of workflow configs.

### Validation (extensions of D13)

**`env` field:**
- `env` must be an array if present.
- Each element must be a non-empty string.
- Each element must be a valid env var name (regex `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`).
- Elements must not be `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `HOME` (sandbox reserves
  these).
- Use `Category: "env"`, `Phase: "config"`, `StepName: ""`.

**`{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` and `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` ban in prompts:**
- Every prompt file referenced by a claude step is scanned for the
  literal tokens `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` and `{{PROJECT_DIR}}`. If either is
  found, emit a validator error (see §13 resolved decision for
  rationale and message).
- Non-claude `command` steps are not scanned. Both tokens remain valid
  inside `command` argv because commands run on the host and see host
  paths.

These additions bring D13's category count to ten.
- Reject anything else via the existing `validator.Error` surface
  (`ralph-tui/internal/validator/validator.go:23-37`). Use a new
  `Category: "env"` value; `Phase: "config"`; `StepName: ""` (this is a
  file-level field, not step-level).

## 9. Code Change Inventory

New and modified files:

### New packages

- **`ralph-tui/internal/sandbox/`** — sandbox-specific logic. Keeps docker
  knowledge localized.
  - `sandbox/image.go` — constants (`ImageTag = "docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code"`,
    mount paths `ContainerRepoPath`, `ContainerProfilePath`, built-in env
    allowlist).
  - `sandbox/command.go` — `BuildRunArgs(projectDir, profileDir string, uid, gid int, cidfile string, envAllowlist []string, model, prompt string) []string`.
    Pure function producing the full `docker run ...` argv. Unit-tested.
  - `sandbox/terminator.go` — given a cidfile path *and* the `*os.Process`
    for the `docker run` CLI invocation, returns a closure of the shape
    `func(signal syscall.Signal) error` that:
    1. Polls the cidfile for up to `cidfileWait` (default 2s) to allow
       the race between `docker run` start and cidfile-write to settle.
    2. If the cidfile appears and contains a 64-char hex string, runs
       `docker kill --signal=<SIGNAL> <cid>`.
    3. If the cidfile is still missing after the poll window, OR
       contains a partial write, falls back to `proc.Signal(signal)` on
       the host docker CLI process. This is the correct recovery path
       *because before the container is running there is nothing to
       orphan* — signaling the CLI aborts the launch cleanly.
    This design addresses the cidfile race: user hits `q` during image
    pull or cold-start, cidfile may not yet exist, and the closure must
    NOT no-op. The prior "nothing to kill" sentinel would orphan a
    container that starts moments after termination.
    The closure is stateless (no captured buffers) so it is safe to
    invoke from `Runner.Terminate()` without additional locking.
  - `sandbox/cidfile.go` — unique cidfile path generation (via
    `os.CreateTemp("", "ralph-*.cid")` then `os.Remove` so the path is
    available to `docker run --cidfile`; this guarantees uniqueness
    even under concurrent ralph-tui invocations and produces a loud,
    specific error if collision ever occurs) and ENOENT-tolerant
    cleanup.
- **`ralph-tui/internal/preflight/`** — startup checks.
  - `preflight/profile.go` — resolves and validates the profile dir.
  - `preflight/docker.go` — docker-binary, daemon-reachability, and
    image-presence checks. Exposes a `Prober` interface for tests.
  - `preflight/run.go` — orchestrates the sequence and prints messages.

### Modified files

- **`ralph-tui/cmd/ralph-tui/main.go`** — wire in preflight before the main
  `Run()`. Register new `create-sandbox` cobra command.
- **`ralph-tui/cmd/ralph-tui/create_sandbox.go`** (new) — cobra subcommand
  implementation calling into `sandbox` + `preflight` packages.
- **`ralph-tui/internal/workflow/run.go`** — `buildStep` for `IsClaude: true`
  now calls `sandbox.BuildRunArgs(...)` instead of constructing the literal
  `["claude", ...]` slice. The resolved step also carries the cidfile
  path (so the Runner can install the terminator closure) and a flag
  telling the Runner to set `cmd.Stdin = bytes.NewReader(nil)` before
  `cmd.Start()` — required to prevent docker's `-i` from sharing the
  host TTY with Bubble Tea (§5 flag rationale).
- **`ralph-tui/internal/workflow/workflow.go`** — `Runner` gains:
  - `currentTerminator func(syscall.Signal) error` field alongside
    `currentProc`, guarded by the same `processMu` mutex that already
    protects `currentProc`, `procDone`, and `terminated`
    (`workflow.go:27-31`). Read/write sites must acquire `processMu`.
  - `SetTerminator(func(syscall.Signal) error)` called by sandboxed
    steps before `cmd.Start()`. Cleared in the same `defer` that
    clears `currentProc` (`workflow.go:144-149`), so terminator and
    process lifetimes stay matched.
  - `Terminate()` snapshots `currentTerminator` under `processMu`. If
    non-nil, the TERM and KILL paths call `terminator(syscall.SIGTERM)`
    and `terminator(syscall.SIGKILL)` instead of `proc.Signal`/`proc.Kill`.
    The existing 3-second grace timer is preserved; escalation stays
    in `Runner` and the closure remains stateless (§4.13).
- **`ralph-tui/internal/steps/steps.go`** — parse new top-level `env` field
  on `StepFile` (alongside `Initialize`/`Iteration`/`Finalize`); plumb it
  into `buildStep`'s caller chain so `sandbox.BuildRunArgs` can see the
  list. `BuildPrompt` itself does not need to change.
- **`ralph-tui/internal/validator/validator.go`** — D13 lives here
  (`Error` type at lines 23-37, `vFile` at 56-60). Extend `vFile` with
  `Env *[]string` and add a validation category for env names. Errors
  use the existing `validator.Error` type (not `ConfigError` — that name
  was shorthand; correct the spec here).
- **`ralph-tui/internal/version/version.go`** — bump `0.2.2` → `0.3.0`.

### New test files
- `ralph-tui/internal/sandbox/command_test.go` — golden argv tests (§10a).
- `ralph-tui/internal/sandbox/cidfile_test.go` — unique path generation
  and ENOENT-tolerant cleanup.
- `ralph-tui/internal/preflight/run_test.go` — preflight matrix with
  injected `Prober` (§10b).
- `ralph-tui/internal/validator/validator_test.go` — extend existing
  file with cases covering the new `env` field (valid names, invalid
  regex, non-string elements, non-array top-level value).

### Files deliberately untouched
- `prompts/*.md` — unchanged. (No prompt file uses `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` or
  `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` today, so the new prompt-scan validator is
  zero-churn for the default workflow.)
- `scripts/*` — unchanged. These run on the host, not in the sandbox.
- Historical plans (`docs/plans/ralph-tui.md`,
  `docs/plans/cobra-cli-option-parsing.md`,
  `docs/plans/ux-corrections/design.md`) — left as historical record;
  current docs and ADRs reflect post-split vocabulary.

### Rename (§4.15)

The split is a pure search-and-replace for the existing identifier plus
new sibling wiring for the target-repo identifier. Grouped here so the
rename diff is reviewable independently inside the sandbox PR.

**Rename of today's `ProjectDir`/`projectDir`/`PROJECT_DIR` → `WorkflowDir`/`workflowDir`/`WORKFLOW_DIR`:**

- `ralph-tui/internal/cli/args.go` — flag registration at line 60 becomes
  `--workflow-dir` (no short form); `Config.ProjectDir` field becomes
  `Config.WorkflowDir`; `resolveProjectDir()` becomes
  `resolveWorkflowDir()`. Same `os.Executable()` + `filepath.EvalSymlinks`
  logic; no behavior change.
- `ralph-tui/internal/cli/args_test.go` — rename
  `TestNewCommand_LongProjectDirFlag` and `TestNewCommand_ShortProjectDirFlag`
  (drop the latter — no short form now); update asserts.
- `ralph-tui/internal/vars/vars.go` — rename `New(projectDir)` →
  `New(workflowDir, projectDir string)`; seed both `WORKFLOW_DIR` and
  `PROJECT_DIR` as persistent-scope vars. Rename existing
  `TestNew_seedsProjectDir` to cover both. **Add `"WORKFLOW_DIR": true`
  to the `reservedNames` map at `vars.go:27-34`** alongside the
  existing `"PROJECT_DIR"` entry, so `captureAs` cannot shadow the
  new built-in (defense-in-depth match for the existing PROJECT_DIR
  reservation). Surfaced by adversarial validator V4 — without this,
  a workflow could silently rebind `WORKFLOW_DIR`.
- `ralph-tui/internal/logger/logger.go` — parameter rename
  (current `workingDir` → post-split `projectDir`); logs stay under
  `{projectDir}/logs/` (target repo), preserving the behavior
  `4f4481b` introduced in 0.2.3. **Not** renamed to `workflowDir` —
  that would revert logs to the install dir and contradict
  `4f4481b`'s commit message ("logs now land under the shell CWD").
  Zero runtime behavior change from 0.2.3; pure identifier rename.
- `ralph-tui/internal/steps/steps.go` — parameter renames on
  `LoadSteps` and `BuildPrompt`.
- `ralph-tui/internal/validator/validator.go` — anchor parameter
  renames throughout `Validate`, `validatePhase`, `validateCommandPath`,
  `extractStepRefs`. Additionally extend the prompt-scan pass (§8) to
  reject both `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` and `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` literal tokens.
- `ralph-tui/internal/workflow/run.go` — `RunConfig.ProjectDir`
  (currently install dir) → `RunConfig.WorkflowDir`. **No sibling
  `RunConfig.ProjectDir` field is added.** The target-repo path
  reaches `Run()` and `buildStep()` via a new `Runner.ProjectDir()`
  getter (see Runner entry below). Update `buildStep`,
  `ResolveCommand`, and `vars.New(...)` call sites to read the
  target repo from the executor (`runner.ProjectDir()`) rather than
  `cfg.ProjectDir`. The `StepExecutor` interface gains a
  `ProjectDir() string` method — update all implementers (production
  `*Runner` and any test doubles).
- `ralph-tui/internal/workflow/workflow.go` — `Runner`'s constructor
  parameter `workingDir` (added in `4f4481b`) is renamed to
  `projectDir`. The Runner field at `workflow.go:24` renames from
  `workingDir` → `projectDir`. **Not a pure rename — also a semantic
  promotion.** Pre-split, `workingDir` always equals the unresolved
  `os.Getwd()` at startup. Post-split, the same field receives
  `cfg.ProjectDir`, which defaults to `os.Getwd()` + `EvalSymlinks`
  but is *overridable* by the user via `--project-dir`. So `cmd.Dir`
  for every subprocess can now point somewhere other than the user's
  shell CWD when the flag is passed. This is the desired endpoint
  (target repo as a first-class flag), but reviewers should not
  treat the runtime semantics as identical to 0.2.3. Surfaced by
  adversarial validator V1. **Resolved in iteration 4:** Runner is
  the single source of truth for the target-repo path. The
  constructor field (renamed from `workingDir` → `projectDir`) is
  exposed via a new `Runner.ProjectDir() string` getter; `Run()`,
  `buildStep()`, and VarTable seeding all read through the getter.
  `RunConfig.ProjectDir` is **not** reintroduced as a sibling field.
  The `StepExecutor` interface gains `ProjectDir() string` so
  `buildStep` can reach the value without touching Runner internals.
  Rationale: single source of truth; removes the redundancy flagged
  by V1; trade-off is that `StepExecutor` now carries target-repo
  knowledge (minor coupling, acceptable given sandbox construction
  also needs the value). Alternatives (keep both; per-call arg)
  recorded in §13.
- `ralph-tui/internal/workflow/run_test.go` — ~70 `ProjectDir: t.TempDir()`
  call sites become `WorkflowDir: t.TempDir()`. Tests that genuinely
  care about target-repo behavior pass the target path via
  `workflow.NewRunner(log, targetDir)` (since `RunConfig.ProjectDir`
  no longer exists — see the getter decision above). Test-double
  executors must implement the new `ProjectDir() string` method.
- `ralph-tui/internal/workflow/workflow_test.go` — `ResolveCommand` tests
  rename to use `workflowDir`. Also renames the existing
  `TestRunStep_UsesWorkingDir` (added in `4f4481b`) to
  `TestRunStep_UsesProjectDir`; the test's assertion (subprocess
  `cmd.Dir` matches the value passed to `NewRunner`) is unchanged.
- `ralph-tui/internal/workflow/run_test.go` — also renames
  `TestCaptureOutput_UsesWorkingDir` (`run_test.go:1649`) to
  `TestCaptureOutput_UsesProjectDir`. This is a parallel `CaptureOutput`
  variant of the `RunStep` test and was missed in the first iteration-4
  inventory; surfaced by adversarial validator V7. Also update the
  reference to it in `docs/features/subprocess-execution.md:310`.
- `ralph-tui/cmd/ralph-tui/main.go` — the wiring is now encapsulated
  in the `newServices(cfg, workingDir)` helper added by `4f4481b`.
  Rename the helper's parameter `workingDir` → `projectDir`;
  rename `cfg.ProjectDir` → `cfg.WorkflowDir` at the three remaining
  call sites inside `newServices` (currently `logger.NewLogger`,
  `steps.LoadSteps`, `validator.Validate`, `workflow.NewRunner`).
  Outside `newServices`, `cfg.ProjectDir` also appears in the
  `RunConfig` construction (`main.go:142`) — that site splits into
  `WorkflowDir: cfg.WorkflowDir` and `ProjectDir: cfg.ProjectDir`.
  The top of `main()` renames local `workingDir` → `projectDir`;
  the `os.Getwd()` call becomes an `os.Getwd()` + `filepath.EvalSymlinks`
  pair wrapped by the new `resolveProjectDir()` in `cli/args.go`
  (so the main function delegates resolution to `cli` instead of
  doing it inline). Specific line numbers from `4f4481b`
  (`main.go:46`, `:53`, `:60`, `:71`, `:77`, `:92`, `:142`) are
  shown for orientation and may shift slightly during implementation.
- `ralph-tui/ralph-steps.json` — line 3 Splash step's `{{PROJECT_DIR}}`
  flips to `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` (ralph-art.txt lives in the workflow
  bundle, not the target repo).
- ~~`ralph-tui/bin/ralph-steps.json`~~ — **dropped from inventory.**
  The entire `bin/` tree is gitignored (`.gitignore:9`); editing it
  is either a no-op (untracked) or introduces a tracked copy that
  diverges from `make build` output. Adversarial validator V5.

**New identifier `ProjectDir`/`projectDir`/`PROJECT_DIR` for the target repo:**

- `ralph-tui/internal/cli/args.go` — new `--project-dir` flag (no short
  form) and new `Config.ProjectDir` field. New `resolveProjectDir()`
  using `os.Getwd()` + `filepath.EvalSymlinks`. This replaces the
  inline `os.Getwd()` call at `cmd/ralph-tui/main.go:77` added by
  `4f4481b`; main.go delegates target-repo resolution to `cli`. Both
  resolutions run in `RunE` and are validated (directory exists)
  before the runner starts. **Note:** the 0.2.3 `os.Getwd()` call
  does not run through `EvalSymlinks`; the split adds the symlink
  dereference for parity with `resolveWorkflowDir()`.
- `ralph-tui/internal/cli/args_test.go` — new test cases for
  `--project-dir` long flag, default = cwd behavior, nonexistent
  directory rejection.
- `ralph-tui/cmd/ralph-tui/main_test.go` — the `TestNewServices_*`
  tests added by `4f4481b` (verifying logger binds to workingDir,
  runner binds to workingDir, steps loads from ProjectDir) renamed to
  use the split vocabulary: logger/runner bind to new `ProjectDir`
  (target repo); steps/validator bind to new `WorkflowDir` (install
  dir). Assertion logic is unchanged, but **test comments and
  variable names** (e.g., local `installDir := t.TempDir()` pairs
  and comments referencing "the bug where subprocess cmd.Dir... were
  mistakenly bound to the install dir") must be rewritten to match
  the split vocabulary — a mechanical identifier rename leaves stale
  doc strings contradicting the new names. Surfaced by adversarial
  validator V3.
- `ralph-tui/internal/vars/vars.go` — seed `PROJECT_DIR` persistent var
  from the new parameter (see rename block above).
- `ralph-tui/internal/workflow/run.go` — new `RunConfig.ProjectDir`
  plumbs through to `sandbox.BuildRunArgs(projectDir, profileDir, ...)`
  (`BuildRunArgs`'s first parameter at `design.md:385` now
  unambiguously means target repo).
- `ralph-tui/internal/workflow/run_test.go` — a new test block asserts
  `ProjectDir` is routed into the sandbox mount arg for claude steps.
- `ralph-tui/cmd/ralph-tui/main.go` — pass `cfg.ProjectDir` into the
  runner alongside `cfg.WorkflowDir`.

**Subcommand scope:**

- `ralph-tui/cmd/ralph-tui/create_sandbox.go` (new; §9 existing entry)
  registers **neither** `--workflow-dir` nor `--project-dir`. Both
  flags live on the root/run command only, not `PersistentFlags()`.
  `create-sandbox` is workflow-agnostic.

**ADR changes (see §12):**

- `docs/adr/<timestamp>-workflow-project-dir-split.md` — new ADR
  capturing the split decision; referenced from §4.15.
- `docs/adr/20260409135303-cobra-cli-framework.md` — in-place updates
  to the two `-project-dir` references (lines 12, 79) and a trailing
  "Updates" note pointing at the new ADR. The cobra decision itself is
  unchanged; only the flag names it mentions.

**Validation:**

The generalized prompt-scan rule (§8) uses the same
`Category`/`Phase`/`StepName` shape as the original `{{PROJECT_DIR}}`
ban. Error message updated to name both tokens (§13).

**Default workflow content:**

- `ralph-tui/ralph-steps.json` — `env` entries remain untouched; only
  line 3's Splash token flips (`{{PROJECT_DIR}}` → `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}`).
  If a migration to add `GITHUB_TOKEN` etc. is needed for the default
  loop, that's a separate content change.

## 10. Testing Plan

### (a) Unit-test the command builder
`sandbox/command_test.go`:
- Golden-test the full argv slice for a representative input (verifies
  flag ordering, mount paths, env expansion, literal flag strings).
- Covers: built-in env vars present on host, absent on host, user
  allowlist overlap with built-ins, duplicate entries, empty user list.
- Boundary: prompts containing shell metacharacters, newlines, embedded
  quotes — confirming they pass through as a single argv element.

### (b) Unit-test the preflight with injected prober
`preflight/run_test.go`:
- Inject a fake `Prober` that returns configurable results for each check.
- Test matrix:
  - Profile dir missing.
  - Profile dir points to a file, not a directory.
  - Docker binary not on PATH.
  - Docker binary present but daemon unreachable.
  - Image not present locally.
  - All green.
- Verify exact user-facing message strings (locking in copy). Verify
  exit code (non-zero) signaled via returned error or sentinel.

### (c) Extend validator tests for the `env` field
`validator_test.go` gains cases covering:
- Missing `env` key → equivalent to empty list (no error).
- `env: []` → no error.
- `env: ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]` → no error.
- `env: [""]` → error (empty name).
- `env: ["1BAD"]` → error (regex violation).
- `env: [123]` → error (non-string element, reported via JSON decode).
- `env: "GITHUB_TOKEN"` → error (top-level value must be an array).
- `env: ["CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR"]` → error (sandbox-reserved).
- `env: ["HOME"]` → error (sandbox-reserved).
- `captureAs: "WORKFLOW_DIR"` → error (reserved built-in; parallel
  to existing `captureAs: "PROJECT_DIR"` rejection). Added alongside
  the `reservedNames` map update in `vars/vars.go` (see §9).
- Prompt file containing `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` referenced by a claude
  step → error with exact `Problem` string from §13.
- Prompt file containing `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` referenced by a claude step
  → error with exact `Problem` string from §13.
- Prompt file containing neither → clean.
- `command` step containing `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` → clean (ban is
  prompt-only).
- `command` step containing `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` → clean (ban is
  prompt-only).
Include both the error category/phase/stepName shape and the exact
`Problem` string in assertions, matching the existing test style.

### (d) Manual validation checklist (in the plan, not automated)
Before merging, a human runs:
- [ ] `ralph-tui create-sandbox` on a fresh image cache succeeds and prints
      structured output.
- [ ] `ralph-tui create-sandbox` on a present image skips pull, still
      smoke-tests.
- [ ] `ralph-tui create-sandbox --force` re-pulls even if present.
- [ ] `ralph-tui -n 1` against a real issue runs claude successfully and
      writes repo files owned by host UID.
- [ ] `q` + `y` mid-claude-step terminates cleanly — `docker ps` shows no
      orphan containers; `/tmp/ralph-*.cid` files are cleaned up.
- [ ] Ctrl+C (SIGINT) produces the same clean termination.
- [ ] Running with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-testdouble` mounts the
      correct profile (confirmed by claude using that session).
- [ ] Running with an `env: ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]` entry and `GITHUB_TOKEN` set
      on the host — claude inside the sandbox reports the var is set
      (verified via a scratch prompt like `echo $GITHUB_TOKEN`).
- [ ] Running with `env: ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` unset — no
      error, claude just doesn't see the var.
- [ ] Removing the image (`docker rmi`) and running `ralph-tui` produces
      the "sandbox missing, run create-sandbox" error and exits 1.
- [ ] Stopping the Docker daemon produces the "daemon not running" error.
- [ ] Deleting `~/.claude` produces the "profile not found" error.

### (e) Not doing
No automated integration test that hits real Docker. Value over (a)+(b)+(d)
is small; adds a CI requirement for docker-in-docker or a host daemon;
and brings network/registry flakiness into the suite. The manual checklist
catches realism gaps.

## 11. Migration & Rollout

### Breaking change
This release removes the ability to run claude without Docker. Existing
users will see a preflight error on the first run after upgrading until
they run `ralph-tui create-sandbox`.

Per `docs/coding-standards/versioning.md`, this is a `y` bump under the
`0.y.z` scheme: `0.2.2` → `0.3.0`.

**Characterization of the change**: `0.3.0` bundles three independently-
breaking changes to the public API surface named by
`docs/coding-standards/versioning.md:19` (CLI flags, `ralph-steps.json`
schema, `{{VAR}}` language, environment dependencies):

1. **Environment-breaking** — Docker becomes a hard runtime dependency,
   so a previously-valid config no longer produces the same workflow
   (it fails preflight).
2. **CLI-flag-breaking** — `--project-dir` is renamed to `--workflow-dir`
   for its current meaning, and `--project-dir` is reintroduced with a
   new meaning (target repo). No deprecation alias. Short forms
   dropped. Scripts passing the old `-p` or `--project-dir <workflow-bundle>`
   will break loudly at flag-parse or silently mount the wrong directory
   if not updated — hence the MINOR (breaking) bump, not PATCH.
3. **Schema-additive and VAR-language change** — new top-level `env`
   field in `ralph-steps.json` (backwards-compatible) plus a new
   `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` built-in and a behavior change for `{{PROJECT_DIR}}`
   (now means target repo, not workflow bundle). The default
   `ralph-steps.json:3` flips from `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` to
   `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` — so any user who copied the default workflow
   verbatim will continue to work (because the default config ships
   with them); any user whose own `ralph-steps.json` uses
   `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` to mean "workflow bundle" must rename it to
   `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}`.

Under the versioning standard's §2 rule ("Any existing user's
ralph-steps.json that was valid before must still be valid and still
produce the same workflow"), (1) and (2) and the `{{PROJECT_DIR}}`
semantic change in (3) would all be MAJOR in a `1.y.z` regime. They
are MINOR here *only* under the `0.y.z` escape hatch. The first
`1.0.0` release must not silently absorb changes of this shape —
future breaking environment dependencies, flag renames, or variable-
token resemantications will each be MAJOR.

New user-visible surface:
- `create-sandbox` subcommand
- `env` top-level field in `ralph-steps.json`
- `--workflow-dir` flag (rename of `--project-dir`)
- `--project-dir` flag (reintroduced, new meaning: target repo)
- `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` built-in variable
- Three new startup error conditions with exit code 1
- Docker required as a runtime dependency

### Upgrade path
1. User updates ralph-tui to `0.3.0`.
2. If the user's invocation passes `-p` or `--project-dir`: cobra
   errors at flag-parse. The error prints both new flag names. User
   replaces the old argument with `--workflow-dir` (for the current
   meaning) and optionally adds `--project-dir` (for target repo, else
   defaults to `os.Getwd()` + `EvalSymlinks`).
3. If the user's custom `ralph-steps.json` uses `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` to
   mean the workflow bundle (paths like `{{PROJECT_DIR}}/prompts/foo.md`
   in claude prompts, **or** `{{PROJECT_DIR}}/scripts/foo` in `command`
   step argv): the failure surfaces are *different* and the user
   should be prepared for both:
   - **Claude prompts**: validator errors at startup naming the
     offending step (§8 ban). User renames tokens to `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}`.
   - **`command` steps**: validator does **not** scan these (`{{VAR}}`
     tokens in `command` argv are supported, just now with new
     meaning). Failure is a runtime `exec: no such file` at first
     run. User must audit their `ralph-steps.json` for any
     `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` token referring to workflow-bundle assets
     (scripts, art files, config) and rename to `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}`.
     Adversarial validator V6 flagged this as silent-failure surface;
     implementers should consider adding a best-effort startup
     warning that scans command-step argv for `{{PROJECT_DIR}}`
     tokens and prints a one-time migration note during the 0.3.0
     window.
4. **Symlinked invocation path change.** If the user invokes ralph-tui
   from a path that is itself a symlink (e.g., `/Users/me/dev`
   resolving to `/private/...`), the new `resolveProjectDir()` will
   pass the value through `filepath.EvalSymlinks`. Paths printed in
   log lines, error messages, and `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` substitutions
   will be the realpath rather than the user-typed symlink path.
   Same behavior already applies to `WORKFLOW_DIR` (via
   `resolveWorkflowDir()`) — this aligns the two. Surfaced by
   adversarial validator V8.
4. First run prints: `Claude sandbox image is missing. Run: ralph-tui create-sandbox` and exits 1.
5. User runs `ralph-tui create-sandbox` — image pulls, smoke test passes.
6. Normal runs resume.

### Rollback
If sandboxed claude turns out to break a specific workflow in production,
the rollback is: pin to `ralph-tui 0.2.x` until a fix ships. No data
migration is needed — ralph-tui state lives only in the target repo.

## 12. Docs That Need Updating on Implementation

These are *followup* deliverables, not part of this plan. Each should be
authored as part of the implementation PR or a follow-up doc PR.

- **New**: `docs/features/docker-sandbox.md` — feature doc describing the
  sandbox architecture, mount layout, env allowlist, and command shape.
- **New**: `docs/adr/<timestamp>-require-docker-sandbox.md` — records the
  decision to make Docker a runtime requirement (sibling to the
  narrow-reading-principle ADR).
- **New**: `docs/how-to/setting-up-docker-sandbox.md` — user-facing setup
  guide: install Docker, run `create-sandbox`, authenticate claude profile,
  configure `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for multi-profile setups.
- **Update**: `docs/features/subprocess-execution.md` — document the new
  `Runner.currentTerminator` closure and the docker-kill-via-cidfile
  termination path.
- **Update**: `docs/features/step-definitions.md` — document the new
  top-level `env` field and the layered allowlist behavior.
- **Update**: `docs/features/config-validation.md` — document the new
  validation rules for the `env` field and the
  `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}`/`{{PROJECT_DIR}}`-in-prompts ban.
- **Update**: `docs/how-to/variable-output-and-injection.md` — note
  that `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` and `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` are valid only in
  `command` steps, not in prompt files (since sandboxed claude cannot
  see the host path), and document the semantics of each token after
  the §4.15 split.
- **Update**: `CLAUDE.md` — add pointers to the new feature doc, ADR, and
  how-to guide under the appropriate sections. Also replace the two
  references to project-directory resolution in the "Key Design
  Decisions" and build-and-run sections to use `--workflow-dir` and
  introduce `--project-dir` alongside it.

**Rename-driven doc updates (§4.15):**

- **New**: `docs/adr/<timestamp>-workflow-project-dir-split.md` — records
  the split decision (see §9 Rename ADR changes).
- **Update**: `docs/adr/20260409135303-cobra-cli-framework.md` — in-place
  replacement of `-project-dir` at lines 12 and 79; trailing "Updates"
  note pointing to the new split ADR.
- **Update**: `docs/adr/20260413162428-workflow-project-dir-split.md` —
  amend the Context section in place to reflect that commit
  `4f4481b` (0.2.3) introduced an internal `workingDir` capture via
  `os.Getwd()` at `cmd/ralph-tui/main.go:77` that is not surfaced
  as a flag/variable, and the split promotes it. Decision section
  unchanged. See §13 ADR-context-inaccuracy resolution.
- **Update**: `docs/architecture.md` — update line 164 project-directory
  resolution prose.
- **Update**: `docs/features/cli-configuration.md` — rewrite flag
  registration, resolution, and `ProjectDir` fan-out sections to cover
  both `--workflow-dir` and `--project-dir`; retitle test-case
  documentation.
- **Update**: `docs/features/step-definitions.md` — `LoadSteps(projectDir)`
  / `BuildPrompt(projectDir)` signatures become `workflowDir` in
  docs; add note that `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` and `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` are
  both seeded into the VarTable at startup.
- **Update**: `docs/features/file-logging.md` — log directory is under
  `{workflowDir}/logs/`, not `{projectDir}/logs/`.
- **Update**: `docs/features/variable-state.md` — rename the seeded
  built-in from `PROJECT_DIR` to `WORKFLOW_DIR`; add `PROJECT_DIR` as
  the new sibling built-in.
- **Update**: `docs/coding-standards/api-design.md` — update the example
  signatures at lines 35 and 178 from `BuildPrompt(projectDir, ...)` to
  `BuildPrompt(workflowDir, ...)`.
- **Update**: `docs/coding-standards/go-patterns.md` — line 294's
  symlink-safe-project-directory-resolution section retitles to cover
  both resolutions (workflow dir via executable path + target repo via
  cwd), both running through `filepath.EvalSymlinks`.
- **Update**: `docs/coding-standards/error-handling.md` — line 89's
  error-message example updates to reference the workflow-dir
  resolution path.
- **Update**: `docs/how-to/building-custom-workflows.md` — line 120
  rewrites `{projectDir}/scripts/deploy` as `{workflowDir}/scripts/deploy`.
- **Update**: `docs/how-to/debugging-a-run.md` — line 111 reproduction
  instructions switch `--project-dir` → `--workflow-dir`; add note that
  `--project-dir` now controls the target repo cwd.
- **Update**: `docs/how-to/getting-started.md` and
  `docs/how-to/debugging-a-run.md` — add instruction that users
  should add `logs/` to their target repo's `.gitignore` before the
  first ralph-tui run. Since `4f4481b` (0.2.3), logs land under the
  target repo's CWD; pr9k's own `.gitignore` does not currently
  exclude `logs/` so other target repos are on their own. Surfaced
  by adversarial validator V2. (Alternative: auto-create a
  `.gitignore` entry on first run, or emit a warning. Implementation
  PR decides.)
- **Update**: `docs/coding-standards/versioning.md` — one-line addition
  to the public-API list reflecting that both flag names and both
  `{{VAR}}` tokens are covered.

**Historical plans left untouched** (not in the update list): this is
a deliberate choice per Question 6 — `docs/plans/ralph-tui.md`,
`docs/plans/cobra-cli-option-parsing.md`, and
`docs/plans/ux-corrections/design.md` describe prior trajectories and
are preserved as-written. Current docs and the new ADR are the source
of truth for today's vocabulary.

## 13. Open Questions & Known Risks

### `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` and `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` inside claude prompts — resolved

**Decision:** Reject both `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` and `{{PROJECT_DIR}}`
when either appears in any prompt file referenced by a claude step.
Both built-ins remain available for non-claude `command` steps (which
continue to run on the host and see host paths).

**Why:** After the §4.15 split, the VarTable seeds two persistent
vars:

- `WORKFLOW_DIR` — host absolute path to the workflow bundle, resolved
  from `os.Executable()` + `filepath.EvalSymlinks`
  (`ralph-tui/internal/cli/args.go:resolveWorkflowDir`). The bundle is
  **not** bind-mounted into the sandbox, so a prompt containing
  `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}/foo` would hand claude a host path that doesn't
  exist inside the container.
- `PROJECT_DIR` — host absolute path to the target repo, resolved from
  `os.Getwd()` + `filepath.EvalSymlinks` or the explicit
  `--project-dir` flag. The target repo **is** bind-mounted, but at
  `/home/agent/workspace` (not at the host path), so a prompt
  containing `{{PROJECT_DIR}}/foo` still hands claude a path that
  doesn't exist inside the container.

In both cases claude would either fail visibly, waste tokens searching
for the file, or hallucinate its contents. Banning both tokens in
prompts is the simplest rule that avoids this — and it preserves
phase-only substitution (no `IsClaude`-aware special-casing in
`vars.go`), which the narrow-reading-principle ADR recommends.
Today no prompt file uses either token, so the ban is zero-churn for
the default workflow.

Inside the container claude's cwd is `/home/agent/workspace` (the
workspace root, `-w` in §5); relative paths are the natural idiom.

**Implementation sketch (extends §8 validation):**
- D13 validator already reads every prompt file referenced by a claude
  step (file-existence check in `validator.go`). Add one scan pass
  that rejects either `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` or `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` literal
  token in prompt bodies.
- New `Category: "prompt"` (or reuse existing prompt-related category)
  with `Phase: <step's phase>`, `StepName: <step name>`, and
  `Problem`: `prompt %s: {{WORKFLOW_DIR}} and {{PROJECT_DIR}} are not valid inside prompt files — they expand to host paths that do not exist inside the sandbox. Use paths relative to the workspace root (claude's cwd is the target repo root inside the container).`
- Non-claude command steps are unaffected — `ResolveCommand` in
  `run.go` still substitutes the host paths and commands still run on
  the host.
- Add validator test cases: prompt containing `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` →
  error; prompt containing `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` → error; prompt
  containing both → error (report at least once; exact shape decided
  at implementation time); prompt without either → clean; command
  containing either token → clean.

**Docs follow-up** (in §12's "docs to update" list):
- `docs/how-to/variable-output-and-injection.md` — note that
  `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` and `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` are valid only in `command`
  steps, not in prompt files; document both tokens' post-split
  semantics.

### Runner signature post-split (resolved in iteration 4)

Current code (post-`4f4481b`) has:

```go
func NewRunner(log *logger.Logger, workingDir string) *Runner
```

where `workingDir` is the target repo cwd. After the §4.15 split,
the target-repo path needs to reach two consumers: Runner (for
`cmd.Dir`) and `Run()` / `buildStep` (for VarTable seeding and
`sandbox.BuildRunArgs`). Three options were considered:

- **(A) Keep both** — Runner field + `RunConfig.ProjectDir`, same
  value carried twice. Minimal diff; redundant.
- **(B) Runner getter** — Runner field is the single source of
  truth; add `Runner.ProjectDir() string`; `StepExecutor` grows a
  `ProjectDir()` method. Eliminates redundancy; adds minor coupling
  to the executor interface.
- **(C) Per-call arg** — drop Runner's field; pass target repo to
  each `RunStep` call. Cleaner separation but bigger diff.

**Decision: Option B.** Rationale: single source of truth;
eliminates the V1 redundancy flagged by adversarial validation;
`StepExecutor` already carries step-execution knowledge so extending
it with `ProjectDir()` is a small, bounded coupling. Option A was
rejected because the redundancy motivated V1 in the first place.
Option C was rejected because setting `cmd.Dir` per-call — rather
than once at Runner construction — would expand the diff beyond
the rename and complicate `CaptureOutput`, which also reads
`workingDir` at `workflow.go:245`.

Implementation: §9 entries for `workflow.go` and `run.go` updated
accordingly.

### ADR context inaccuracy (resolved in iteration 4)

`docs/adr/20260413162428-workflow-project-dir-split.md` was written
before `4f4481b` and states (lines ~30-31): *"there is no `TargetRepo`
field in `cli.Config` or `workflow.RunConfig`, no flag for it, and
no call to `os.Getwd()` anywhere in the codebase."* The `os.Getwd()`
clause is no longer true — `cmd/ralph-tui/main.go:77` now calls it.

**Decision: amend in place.** In the 0.3.0 PR that implements the
split, edit the ADR's Context section to note that an internal
`workingDir` capture exists as of commit `4f4481b` (0.2.3) but is
not surfaced as a user-facing flag/variable — the split promotes
that internal capture to first-class surface. The Decision section
is unchanged. Rationale: content-only edit to an accepted ADR is
the least-disruptive way to keep the record accurate; alternatives
(dedicated "Updates" section, leaving the inaccuracy, superseding
with a new ADR) were considered and rejected as either overkill
for a single stale observation or as trip hazards for future
readers.

Add this edit to §12's docs-update list.

### To verify during implementation
- **Prompt size vs. ARG_MAX.** macOS `getconf ARG_MAX` is 1,048,576 bytes
  (~1MB) as of Sonoma, but in practice argv+environ share that budget and
  long prompts plus env can push against it. Current direct-claude
  invocation already passes prompts as `-p <arg>`, so this isn't *new*, but
  adding docker wrapping + env-e flags slightly tightens the budget.
  If a prompt overflows, the failure mode is a loud `argument list too
  long` — easy to diagnose, acceptable for v1. Revisit via stdin piping if
  it bites.
- **Smoke-test realism.** §10(d)'s manual checklist includes a `-n 1` real
  run; the §6 automated `claude --version` smoke test in `create-sandbox`
  does not exercise writes. If `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` causes filesystem write
  problems inside the image (e.g., the `agent` user can't write to
  `/home/agent/.cache`), `create-sandbox` will greenlight a sandbox that
  then fails on the first real claude step. The manual checklist catches
  this; consider promoting a lightweight write-smoke (e.g., `claude -p "echo hello > /home/agent/workspace/smoke.txt"`
  with a temp mount) into `create-sandbox` if problems recur.
- **Tini+claude-code interaction.** `--init` installs tini as PID 1. Tini
  has sensible defaults but some Node applications have been observed to
  delay SIGTERM handling; if the 3-second grace period proves too short in
  practice, widening it is a one-line change in `workflow.go`.

### Adversarial-review notes (incorporated above)
- **Stdin/TTY collision with Bubble Tea** (F1): addressed in §5 and §9
  by requiring `cmd.Stdin = bytes.NewReader(nil)` at the invocation site.
- **Cidfile race during kill window** (F2): addressed in §9
  `sandbox/terminator.go` spec — poll + CLI-signal fallback.
- **Smoke-test realism** (F3, F8): addressed in §6 with distinct error
  messages per failure cause and a non-failing warning when output
  doesn't match semver.
- **`gh`/`curl` fallback silent corruption** (F4): threat-model table
  §3 rephrased — the guarantee is "no host tool access," not "no
  semantic regression."
- **Profile rw + SIGKILL mid-refresh** (F6): §7 preflight now warns on
  zero-byte `.credentials.json`.
- **Env regex stricter than docker** (F7): accepted; §8 validation is
  intentionally stricter than the kernel accepts.
- **`bypassPermissions` still lets claude wipe its own profile** (F9):
  acknowledged here — the sandbox does not reduce credentials-file
  risk versus today's direct invocation. §3 threat table lists this as
  accepted residual.
- **Versioning characterization** (F10): §11 now distinguishes
  schema-additive from environment-breaking and calls out the
  implication for a future `1.0.0`.
- **Tini + node SIGTERM behavior** (F6 remaining risk, §13 original
  note): unchanged — the 3s grace may need widening if observed.
- **ARG_MAX under docker wrapping** (original §13 note): unchanged.
- **Digest drift between `create-sandbox` and first run** (§4.10
  tradeoff, adversarial F3 variant): accepted by §4.10's tag-only
  design; users opt into upstream cadence.
- **Image's `agent` user UID vs. host UID** (F3-5 remaining risk): not
  caught by §6 smoke (no mounts); §10(d) manual checklist catches it.

### Deferred
- **Network egress restriction** (goal b): would require custom network,
  DNS allowlist, or an egress proxy. Significant complexity for marginal
  additional safety given claude needs Anthropic API + GitHub + public
  registries. Revisit if a compelling threat emerges.
- **Refactoring claude-step resolution into `ralph-steps.json`**: the
  narrow-reading-principle ADR favors this, but doing it simultaneously
  with the sandbox change doubles the PR size. Tracked as future work.
- **Per-step sandbox customization** (different images, different env
  allowlists per step): all claude steps today share the same threat
  profile. If workflows diverge (e.g., some steps need AWS creds and
  others don't), we can add per-step `env` overrides then. Not v1.
- **Supply-chain pinning (digest-based image references)**: user chose
  tag-based pulls for upgrade ergonomics. If a supply-chain incident
  makes reproducibility more important than ease, §4.10 can be revisited.

## 14. Plan Review Summary

This plan was iteratively reviewed against the codebase plus full agent
validation (evidence-based-investigator + adversarial-validator).

### Iterations
- **Iteration 1 (correctness)** — fixed an outright schema error (§8
  example used a non-existent `"steps"` key instead of `initialize` /
  `iteration` / `finalize`); clarified termination escalation ownership
  between `Runner.Terminate()` and the new terminator closure (§4.13,
  §9); pinned the closure signature to `func(syscall.Signal) error`;
  documented mutex coverage for `currentTerminator`; surfaced
  `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` substitution semantics inside sandboxed prompts as
  an unresolved decision needing user input (§13).
- **Iteration 2 (consistency)** — corrected references to the D13
  validator file path (`internal/validator/validator.go`, not
  `internal/steps/validate.go`) and to the type name (`validator.Error`,
  not `ConfigError`); added missing test files to the §9 inventory; added
  §10(c) extending validator tests; tightened §7 profile dir check to
  also reject non-directory paths; fixed cross-references (§13 to
  §10(d) and §6, not §11 and "Q7"); renamed §10's "Not doing" to (e)
  to avoid label collision.
- **Iteration 3 (completeness)** — added prohibition on `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
  and `HOME` in user env list with validator enforcement; added the
  `env` validator category to D13's category count.
- **Iteration 4 (post-`4f4481b` reconciliation, 2026-04-13)** — a
  code change landed between design freeze and re-review that
  introduced an internal `workingDir` (captured via `os.Getwd()` in
  `main.go`) and routed it to the logger and runner without touching
  flags or variables, bumping to `0.2.3`. This iteration reconciled
  the plan with that state: (a) fixed the version-bump baseline
  (`0.2.2` → `0.2.3`); (b) noted that the split now *promotes* an
  existing internal capture rather than introducing `os.Getwd()` for
  the first time (§4.15 "Relation to the `0.2.3` `workingDir`
  capture"); (c) corrected the logger-rename claim — logs remain
  under the target repo (`4f4481b`'s decision), so the parameter
  renames `workingDir` → `projectDir`, not `workingDir` →
  `workflowDir`; (d) rewrote the `main.go` change entry to target
  the new `newServices` helper and its three internal call sites
  instead of the pre-`4f4481b` inline wiring; (e) added the existing
  `TestRunStep_UsesWorkingDir` and `TestNewServices_*` tests to the
  rename inventory; (f) surfaced two ambiguities in §13 — Runner
  signature choice and the accepted ADR's now-inaccurate "no
  `os.Getwd()` anywhere" context clause — neither of which blocks
  implementation.
- **Iteration 4 agent validation (same date)** — the iteration-4
  reconciliation itself was re-validated against the codebase with
  `evidence-based-investigator` + `adversarial-validator` agents.
  - **Evidence-based-investigator**: 9 of 10 iteration-4 claims
    VERIFIED with file:line evidence. The one outlier (claim 7) was
    a framing clarification: `version.Version` is currently `0.2.3`
    so "0.3.0 is a bump from 0.2.3" stands, but the constant has
    not yet been bumped (pending PR).
  - **Adversarial-validator** surfaced 8 findings:
    - V1 (HIGH): "pure rename" framing for Runner field hid a
      semantic promotion (cmd.Dir becomes flag-overridable, not
      always `os.Getwd()`). Fixed in §9 Runner entry + §11 upgrade
      path with explicit wording.
    - V2 (MED): target repo `logs/` is not in the user's
      `.gitignore` by default. Added §12 doc updates for
      `getting-started.md` and `debugging-a-run.md`.
    - V3 (LOW): mechanical identifier rename leaves stale comments
      in `main_test.go`. Updated §9 entry to mandate comment
      rewording.
    - V4 (MED — correctness gap): `reservedNames` map in `vars.go`
      is missing `"WORKFLOW_DIR"` entry. Updated §9 vars.go bullet
      and §10 validator test plan.
    - V5 (LOW): `bin/ralph-steps.json` is gitignored. Dropped from
      §9 rename inventory.
    - V6 (MED): `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` in `command` steps silently flips
      meaning post-split; validator does not scan command argv.
      Strengthened §11 upgrade-path bullet 3 and proposed a
      best-effort startup warning.
    - V7 (LOW): `TestCaptureOutput_UsesWorkingDir` missed from
      rename inventory. Added to §9.
    - V8 (LOW): `EvalSymlinks` on `cfg.ProjectDir` means symlinked
      invocation paths flip to realpaths in logs/messages. Added
      §11 upgrade-path bullet 4.
- **Iteration 4 ambiguity resolutions (user-supplied, 2026-04-13)** —
  two ambiguities surfaced in §13 by the post-`4f4481b`
  reconciliation were resolved with the user:
  - **Runner signature post-split:** chose Option B — Runner is the
    single source of truth for the target-repo path via a new
    `Runner.ProjectDir() string` getter; `StepExecutor` gains a
    `ProjectDir()` method; `RunConfig.ProjectDir` is not
    reintroduced. Eliminates the V1 redundancy.
  - **ADR context inaccuracy:** chose amend-in-place — edit
    `docs/adr/20260413162428-workflow-project-dir-split.md` Context
    section in the 0.3.0 PR to note `4f4481b`'s internal capture;
    Decision unchanged; added to §12 docs-update list.
- **Stopped at iteration 4** because remaining open questions
  (image-internal assumptions, runtime behavior) are runtime-only and
  not answerable by further static review.

### Agent validation outcomes
- **evidence-based-investigator**: 9 of 10 plan claims verified against
  file:line evidence; 1 claim (no prompt uses `{{PROJECT_DIR}}`)
  confirmed for `prompts/` but flagged that `ralph-steps.json:3` does
  use it in a non-claude command (runs on host — out of sandbox scope).
  Confirmed there is no existing UID/GID lookup code in ralph-tui.
- **adversarial-validator**: surfaced 10 findings, of which 7 became
  plan changes:
  - F1 (HIGH): docker `-i` could share TTY with Bubble Tea — fixed in
    §5 and §9 by mandating `cmd.Stdin = bytes.NewReader(nil)`.
  - F2 (HIGH): cidfile race during the kill window could orphan
    containers — fixed in §9 by replacing the "missing cidfile = no-op"
    sentinel with poll-then-CLI-signal fallback.
  - F3, F8 (MED): smoke-test could greenlight corrupt or stub images —
    fixed in §6 with cause-specific error messages and a non-failing
    semver-shape warning.
  - F4 (MED): `gh`/`curl` fallback could silently corrupt commits —
    rephrased threat-model row in §3.
  - F6 (MED): SIGKILL during OAuth refresh could brick auth silently —
    added zero-byte `.credentials.json` warning to §7 preflight.
  - F10 (HIGH on framing): versioning characterization muddled —
    clarified in §11 that the `0.3.0` choice is correct only under the
    `0.y.z` escape hatch; equivalent change in a `1.y.z` regime would
    be MAJOR.
  - F5, F7, F9: accepted with explicit framing, not silent acceptance.

### Items resolved during review
1. **`{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` / `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` semantics inside sandboxed
   prompts** — resolved by banning both tokens in prompt files via
   validator extension (see §8 and §13). Non-claude `command` steps
   continue to use the host path for both. Chosen over
   context-dependent remapping because no prompt currently uses either
   token, keeping the substitution language pure and phase-only
   matches the narrow-reading-principle ADR, and the error surfaces at
   preflight rather than mid-run.
2. **`--project-dir` flag and `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` token ambiguity** —
   resolved by splitting each into a pair: `--workflow-dir` /
   `{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` inherits today's semantics (the workflow
   bundle), and `--project-dir` / `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` is reintroduced
   with a new meaning (the target repo). See §4.15 and the new split
   ADR.

### Counts
- 3 review iterations completed.
- 10 plan-claim assumptions challenged via evidence-based agent;
  10 plan-claim assumptions challenged via adversarial agent.
- 7 adversarial findings incorporated as plan changes; 3 accepted with
  documentation update.
- 1 outright correctness bug found and fixed (§8 schema example).
- 4 cross-reference and naming inconsistencies fixed.
- 2 decisions surfaced and resolved during review
  (`{{WORKFLOW_DIR}}` / `{{PROJECT_DIR}}` ban in prompts;
  `--project-dir` split into `--workflow-dir` + `--project-dir`).
- 0 consolidations made — the plan was already well-decomposed; each
  numbered section addresses a distinct concern with low overlap.
