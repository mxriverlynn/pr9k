# Recovering from Step Failures

← [Back to How-To Guides](README.md)

Steps fail. A `git push` conflicts, a Claude step hits a rate limit, a test script returns 1 because of a flake. pr9k pauses when this happens and hands control back to you: **continue**, **retry**, or **quit**. This guide walks through the error-mode flow so you can make the right call when a step fails.

**Prerequisites**: you've launched a run and you're staring at a `[✗]` in the checkbox grid. If you haven't yet, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md) first; the keyboard map and screen layout are documented in [Reading the TUI](reading-the-tui.md). While the TUI is up you can also press `?` to open the live keyboard reference modal.

## What counts as a failure

A step is treated as failed when:

1. The subprocess returns a **non-zero exit code**, AND
2. The process was **not user-terminated** (you didn't press `n` to skip it)

If you pressed `n`, the orchestrator marks the step as done (`[✓]`) and moves on — `n`-initiated skips are not failures, they're intentional user actions.

If the process exited 0, it's done (`[✓]`) regardless of whether stdout was empty or stderr was loud.

Only non-zero-and-not-user-terminated triggers **Error mode**.

## What happens when a step fails

As soon as a step fails, three things happen:

1. The checkbox for the step flips to `[✗]`
2. The shortcut footer changes to `c continue  r retry  q quit` — the TUI is now in error mode
3. The orchestrator pauses and waits for your decision

The workflow is paused until you press a key. You can scroll the log to inspect what went wrong — the streaming stdout and stderr from the failed step are still in the log panel — but no subprocess is running.

## Your three choices

### `c` — Continue

Accept the failure and move on.

- The step stays marked `[✗]` — the failure is visible in the log and the checkbox grid
- The next step in the iteration starts immediately

Use `c` when:

- The failure is expected/benign for this iteration (e.g., `git push` fails because there are no commits to push — your feature step had nothing to do)
- The downstream steps can handle the failed state
- You want to see how far the workflow gets before giving up

### `r` — Retry

Re-run the same step.

- The step stays marked `[✗]` from the previous attempt until the retry begins
- A `── <step name> (retry) ─────────────` separator is written to the log
- The same subprocess command runs again; success clears the `[✗]` to `[✓]`
- If the retry also fails, you land back in Error mode with the same three choices

Retries use the **same resolved command and prompt** as the original attempt. Captured variables from earlier steps in the iteration are not re-fetched — for example, a retry of "Feature work" uses the same `STARTING_SHA` that was captured at the start of the iteration, not a fresh one.

Use `r` when:

- The failure looks transient (network hiccup, rate limit, race condition)
- You just fixed something out-of-band (edited a file, rebooted a service)
- You want a second try before deciding whether to give up

### `q` — Quit

Start the quit confirmation flow.

- Footer changes to `Quit Power-Ralph.9000? (y/n, esc to cancel)`
- Pressing `y` confirms and begins shutdown (footer → `Quitting...`)
- Pressing `n` or `Esc` cancels and returns to error mode so you can still pick `c` or `r`

See [Quitting Gracefully](quitting-gracefully.md) for the full quit flow.

Use `q` when:

- The failure is structural — continuing won't recover
- You need to investigate in another terminal before doing anything else
- The workflow has gone off the rails and you want to stop cleanly

## The orchestrator stays responsive during the pause

While you're sitting in error mode, the workflow is paused waiting for your decision — but the TUI is not frozen. The log panel still streams anything the previous step hadn't flushed yet, scrolling works, the header and footer render on every frame, and `Ctrl+C` still triggers a clean shutdown.

If you leave the workflow paused and walk away, nothing bad happens — no timeout, no auto-retry, no auto-continue. Ralph waits.

## After you choose: what happens next

| Choice | Next step | Checkbox state | Mode |
|--------|-----------|----------------|------|
| `c` | Advance to next step in the iteration | Failed step stays `[✗]` | Back to Normal |
| `r` (success) | This step succeeds, advance | `[✗]` → `[✓]` | Back to Normal |
| `r` (fails again) | Block in error mode again | Stays `[✗]` | Still Error |
| `q` → `y` | Shutdown | Stays `[✗]` | Quitting, then process exits |
| `q` → `n`/`Esc` | Return to error mode pause | Stays `[✗]` | Error |

## Edge cases

### The step terminated itself

If you pressed `n` **during** the step to skip it, a confirmation prompt appears (`Skip current step? y/n, esc to cancel`). Pressing `y` confirms the skip: the subprocess receives SIGTERM (then SIGKILL after 3 seconds). The non-zero exit is treated as a successful, user-initiated termination and the step is marked `[✓]` — no error mode, no pause, just advance. Pressing `n` or `Esc` cancels the skip and returns to normal mode. This is the mechanism behind "skip this step".

### A step's prompt or substitution failed before the subprocess could start

If prompt-file reading or variable substitution fails (e.g., a referenced `promptFile` doesn't exist), pr9k logs `Error preparing initialize step: ...` / `Error preparing steps: ...` / `Error preparing finalize step: ...` to the log body and skips that step, moving to the next. You do **not** enter error mode for build failures — they're treated as "skip this step" at the orchestrator level.

In practice this only happens when the config references a missing prompt file. The validator that runs before the TUI starts catches most of these cases, but file deletions between validation and execution can sneak through.

### A later iteration step re-fails after you chose `c`

Every step is independent. Choosing `c` on iteration 3's "Test writing" doesn't affect iteration 3's "Git push" or iteration 4's "Feature work" — both are still capable of failing and dropping you back into error mode.

### The step timed out but was configured with `onTimeout: "continue"`

If a step's config sets `onTimeout: "continue"` AND the per-step `timeoutSeconds` cap fires, pr9k skips the error-mode pause entirely. You'll see:

1. A one-line banner in the log: `── <step name> timed out after Ns — continuing (onTimeout=continue) ─────────────`
2. The step's checkbox flips to `[!]` (not `[✗]`) so soft-timeouts are visually distinct from hard failures
3. The workflow advances to the next step without prompting

The iteration log still records `status: "failed"` with `notes: "timed out after Ns"` for the affected step, so after-the-fact debugging sees the timeout. The bundled "Test writing" step ships with this policy enabled; see [Setting Step Timeouts](setting-step-timeouts.md) for details.

## Deciding: continue, retry, or quit?

A rough decision tree:

1. **Is the error transient?** (network, rate limit, file-lock race)
   - Yes → `r` (retry once or twice)
   - No → keep reading
2. **Does the next step depend on this step having succeeded?**
   - Yes → `q` (don't corrupt downstream state)
   - No → keep reading
3. **Is there something you need to fix before retrying?**
   - Yes, and it's quick → fix it, then `r`
   - Yes, and it's not quick → `q` (investigate without holding the workflow)
   - No → `c` (accept the failure and see how the rest goes)
