# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**pr9k (Power-Ralph.9000)** is an automated development workflow orchestrator that drives the `claude` CLI through multi-step coding loops. It picks up GitHub issues labeled "ralph", implements features, writes tests, runs code reviews, and pushes — all unattended.

Based on [AI Hero's Getting Started with Ralph](https://www.aihero.dev/getting-started-with-ralph).

## Repository Structure

- `ralph-tui/` — Go TUI orchestrator. See "ralph-tui" section below.
- `scripts/` — Helper scripts (`get_next_issue`, `close_gh_issue`, `get_gh_user`, `get_commit_sha`, `box-text`)
- `prompts/` — Prompt files consumed by the orchestrator. Each prompt is passed to `claude -p`. Prompts use `{{ISSUE_ID}}`, `{{STARTING_SHA}}`, and other `{{VAR}}` tokens that are substituted at runtime.
- `bin/` — Build output from `make build` (binary, prompts, scripts, configs)
- `docs/` — Architecture, feature docs, how-to guides, coding standards, and plans

## Workflow: The Ralph Loop

Each iteration:
1. Find next open issue assigned to user with label "ralph" (lowest number first)
2. Feature work (sonnet) → Test planning (opus) → Test writing (sonnet) → Code review (opus) → Review fixes (sonnet) → Close issue → Update docs (sonnet) → Git push

After all iterations, three finalization steps run:
1. Deferred work — creates issues from `deferred.txt`
2. Lessons learned — codifies from `progress.txt`
3. Final git push

Intermediate files (`progress.txt`, `deferred.txt`, `test-plan.md`, `code-review.md`) are created in the **target repo's working directory**, never committed, and consumed/deleted by later steps.

## Key Design Decisions

- Ralph is invoked **from the target repo** — all subprocesses inherit that cwd
- The project directory is resolved from the executable path via `os.Executable()` + `filepath.EvalSymlinks`
- The `get_next_issue` script sorts open issues and picks the lowest number
- Non-claude steps (`close_gh_issue`, `git push`) run as shell commands defined in JSON configs

## ralph-tui (Go/Glyph)

The Go TUI orchestrator lives in `ralph-tui/`, using [Glyph](https://useglyph.sh/) for real-time streaming output. Full plan in `docs/plans/ralph-tui.md`.

### Build and run

```bash
# Using make (recommended):
make build
./bin/ralph-tui [-n <iterations>] [-p <project-dir>]

# Or build directly:
cd ralph-tui && go build -o ../ralph-tui ./cmd/ralph-tui
./ralph-tui [-n <iterations>] [-p <project-dir>]
```

Use `go build` — `go run` won't work because `projectDir` is resolved via `os.Executable()`.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for detailed architectural documentation including block diagrams, data flow, and links to feature-level docs.

- [`docs/adr/20260410170952-narrow-reading-principle.md`](docs/adr/20260410170952-narrow-reading-principle.md) — Narrow-reading principle: ralph-tui is a generic step runner; workflow content lives in `ralph-steps.json`, not Go code. Apply when evaluating any PR that adds Ralph-specific knowledge to Go code.

## Coding Standards

Apply when changing any user-visible surface or preparing a release.
